# John Lemon Haunted Jaunt Game
CS 410 Game Programming: Group project to build the "John Lemon Haunted Jaunt Game" from Unity with additional elements. We added at least one gameplay element that uses a dot product in some way, one gameplay element that uses linear interpolation in some way, and at least one particle effect.

Game based on Unity's John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt: 3D Beginner https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner

In the repo readme, describe the use of the dot 
product, linear interpolation, and particle effect and how to trigger these in game. Also include 
the names of your team members and the contributions from each team member.

We use the particle effect on the ghosts as they move.
