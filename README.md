# John Lemon Haunted Jaunt Game
CS 410 Game Programming: Group project to build the "John Lemon Haunted Jaunt Game" from Unity with additional elements. Game based on Unity's John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt: 3D Beginner https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner. Going beyond the tutorial, we added one gameplay element that uses a dot product in some way, one gameplay element that uses linear interpolation in some way, and one particle effect. 

-------------------------------
We use dot product to play a heart beat sound when a ghost is close and in front of the character.

We use lerping on the rotation of the Gargoyles.

We use the particle effect on the ghosts as they move.
