# John-Lemon-Game
CS 410 Game Programming: Group project to build the "John Lemon Haunted Jaunt Game" from Unity with additional elements. We added at least one gameplay element that uses a dot product in some way, one gameplay element that uses linear interpolation in some way, and at least one particle effect.
